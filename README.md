## COSSANTHON 2020:

### Date: 
28-Apr-2020 (Tue)

### Description:
In this two-part e-lecture series, I gave a basic introduction to the concept of inverse problems, the motivation behind Bayesian Model Updating, and the tools to address Bayesian Model Updating problems.

In Part I, I gave a brief background behind the concept of model updating and the difference between deterministic and probabilistic model updating. From there, we establish that Bayesian Model Updating falls under the category of probabilistic model updating and its advantage lies in its ability to update one's knowledge from his/her apriori knowledge through making observations.

In Part II, I introduced 3 of the popular sampling techniques used to address Bayesian Model Updating problem: Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), Transitional MArkov Chain Monte Carlo (TMCMC), and Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC). Details to each sampling algorithm will be introduced and described through illustrative flow-charts.

## URBASIS-EU WP1 Meeting:

### Date: 
12-Feb-2021 (Fri)

### Description:
In this talk, I gave a basic introduction to Bayesian Model Updating, advanced sampling techniques, and simple case-studies to demonstrate the implementations as well as to highlight the advantages and disadvantages between the different sampling techniques. Notes and MATLAB codes to these numerical examples presented in this talk are also available here.
