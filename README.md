#### Description:
  
Date: 28-Apr-2020 (Tue)  
  
In this two-part e-lecture series, I gave a basic introduction to the concept of inverse problems, the motivation behind Bayesian Model Updating, and the tools to address Bayesian Model Updating problems.

In Part I, I gave a brief background behind the concept of model updating and the difference between deterministic and probabilistic model updating. From there, we establish that Bayesian Model Updating falls under the category of probabilistic model updating and its advantage lies in its ability to update one's knowledge from his/her apriori knowledge through making observations.

In Part II, I introduced 3 of the popular sampling techniques used to address Bayesian Model Updating problem: Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), Transitional Markov Chain Monte Carlo (TMCMC), and Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC). Details to each sampling algorithm will be introduced and described through illustrative flow-charts.

#### Description:
  
Date: 12-Feb-2021 (Fri)  
  
In this talk, I gave a basic introduction to Bayesian Model Updating, followed by an introduction to the sampling techniques employed (i.e. Markov Chain Monte Carlo, Transitional Markov Chain Monte Carlo, and Sequential Monte Carlo samplers). For each of the sampling techniques, we present simple engineering case-studies to demonstrate its implementation. Finally, we end off the discussion with a summary of the key advantages and disadvantages between the different sampling techniques. Notes and MATLAB codes to these numerical examples presented in this talk are also available here.

#### Description:
  
 Date: 8-Dec-2021 (Wed) 
  
In this lecture is divided into 2 segments. The first segment involves going through the theory of Model updating from which we proceed to discuss the topic on Bayesian Model Updating. This is then followed by an introduction to the sampling techniques employed (i.e. Markov Chain Monte Carlo, Transitional Markov Chain Monte Carlo, and Sequential Monte Carlo samplers). For each of the sampling techniques, we present simple engineering case-studies to demonstrate its implementation. Finally, we conclude the first segment discussion with a summary of the key advantages and disadvantages between the different sampling techniques. 
  
In the second segment, we demonstrate the implementation of OpenCOSSAN to solve a simple Bayesian Model Updating problem involving a Linear Spring-Mass system using the Transitional Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampler. 
  
The lecture notes, worksheet, MATLAB codes to the numerical examples presented in this talk, as well as the OpenCOSSAN MATLAB codes to the practical demonstration are also available here.

## MPSVA 2022 Presentation:

#### Description:
  
 Date: 12-Jul-2021 (Tues) 
  
The Semi-plenary talk was presented at the 10th International Conference on Modern Practice in Stress and Vibration Analysis (MPSVA 2022). 
In the talk, I gave a brief overview on the concept of Bayesian Model Updating, the Transitional Ensemble Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampler, and the Approximate Bayesian computing framework in performing Uncertainty quantification in structural dynamical problems.
  
As an illustration to the Uncertainty quantification framework involving the above concepts, an application problem was presented based on the recent NASA-Langley Uncertainty Quantification Challenge 2019 to which a brief comparison is made between the choice of the distribution model for the random model variables, the type of data used for the Black-box model calibration, and the choice of distance metric used for the Approximate Bayesian computation.
